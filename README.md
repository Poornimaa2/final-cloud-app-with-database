General Notes

An onlinecourse app has already been provided in this repo upon which you will be adding a new assesement feature.

If you want to develop the final project on Theia hosted by IBM Developer Skills Network, you will need to create the same project structure on Theia workspace and save it everytime you close the browser
Or you could develop the final project locally by setting up your own Python runtime and IDE
Hints for the final project are left on source code files
You may choose any cloud platform for deployment (default is IBM Cloud Foundry)
Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)
ER Diagram For your reference, we have prepared the ER diagram design for the new assesement feature.
